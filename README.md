# Card War Game

## Assignment
For a final capstone project I needed to incorporate an external API and create a full stack project. Games are more challenging than other projects and provide lots of opportunity for future features. I selected a free [Cards API](https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/) for this project and focused on experimenting/expanding my front end skills with this project.
