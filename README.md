# Card War Game
Springboard software engineering bootcamp - Cohort Jan 2022
Project started Jan 2023

## Assignment
For a final capstone project I needed to incorporate an external API and create a full stack project. Games tend to be very challenging and provide lots of opportunity for future features. I selected a free [Cards API](https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/) for this project and built my own [Express.js API](https://github.com/nll004/war_cards/tree/main/node_API) to handle CRUD operations for users and game stats. Being more comfortable with the Express API, I focused carefully on validating requests, testing, handling errors and careful documentation to ensure a secure and readable backend API. I added admin validations to support future features and deployed my API on Heroku.

I wanted to challenge myself more on the front end with this particular project. Up to this point I have primarily styled all of my projects with basic CSS and no styling libraries. Games require more animations, transitions and careful styling. I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to experiment with the parts of CSS I have not yet explored to build my knowledge and experience.
