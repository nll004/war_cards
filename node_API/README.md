# War Cards API

This API was developed to serve my implementation of the WAR cards game. It provides CRUD operations for users as well as retrieving and updating game stats for users.

This API was created with:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- JEST testing
- JWT
- JSON validation
- Bcrypt password hashing
- Axios
- PostgreSQL and PG driver

## API Routes

**Requires:**

Body - {username, password, firstName, lastName, email}

**Returns:** { user: { username, firstName, lastName, email }, _token, success } or { error }
