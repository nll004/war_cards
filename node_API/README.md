# War Cards API

This API was developed to support my implementation of the [WAR](https://github.com/nll004/war_cards) cards game. It provides CRUD operations for users as well as retrieving and updating game stats for users.

### Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- JEST testing
- JWT
- JSON validation
- Bcrypt password hashing
- Axios
- PostgreSQL and PG driver

## API Routes

### Base Url

    https://war.herokuapp.com/

### Register new user and get token

    POST /user/register

**Requires:**

Body - {username, password, firstName, lastName, email}

**Returns:** 

{ user: { username, firstName, lastName, email }, _token, success } or { error }

Route checks for existing username/email and hashes password before storing new user. Returns a success boolean, user data (minus password) and a JWT with expiration value, admin boolean and username.

### User login and get token

    POST /user/login

**Requires:**

Body - {username, password}

**Returns:** 

{ success, user: { username, firstName, lastName, email }, _token } or { error }
